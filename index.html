  <h3 class="subhead">About Me</h3>
  <p class="body-text">I'm Quincy Tennyson, a network engineer in the Louisville area who enjoyes a bit of
    code from time to time.  After seven years as an active duty Marine, I returned to Louisville
    in 2013 seeking my bachelor's degree in the University of Louisville's Computer Information Systems program.
    <br>
    <br>
    Interested in learning an entirely new set of skills, I opted for the web development emphasis and here we are.
    <br>
    <br>
    I believe in a highly functional design, without excessive frill, unless of course that's what you like!  Development
    is a creative outlet for me, so I get to enjoy it without relying on it to sustain my family and lifestyle.
    <br>
    <br>
    I hope you enjoy browsing a history of my experience with this lightweight, simply designed website using a bit of HTML/CSS/JS and jQuery.
    <br>
    <br>
    While I have nearly a decade of experience in systems and network administration, my greatest talent lies in bonding
    together the strengths of any team into a targeted effort.  A good team can accomplish the mission, but for a great team
    nothing is impossible.</p>

    <!--'Students in the CIS program at UofL are exposed to a number of courses in software development, beginning with the concepts of object oriented programming in the context of C#.  Programming fundamentals like logic, variables, classes, and methods are discussed in these courses, and students develop their own C# programs over two semesters.
      <br>
      <br>
Beyond the basic programming taught early in the curriculum, later courses cover web architecture, and provide a more robust understanding of full web stacks.  A personal favorite of mine during this time was AngularJS.  Outside of class, a friend and I developed our own application for Google's StartupWeekend using Firebase's mBaaS and AngularJS.  It anonymizes (is that a word?) speaker/audience Q&A interaction, and makes the process far more efficient.
      <br>
